# Akka Example

This example demonstrates what generic server-style code looks like in Akka.

The reason for looking to Akka is that is a mature ecosystem for typed Erlangish concurrency.

Currently this README only discusses only some of the many ideas from the code in this directoryâ€“please see comments in the code for more details about what these demonstrate:
- `GenServerMatchTypes.scala` shows how to use match types to map request types to response types. More on this below.
- `BasicBlocks.scala` shows how things comparable to `gen_server:call` and `gen_server_cast` are typed in Akka.

## IDE

- sbt
- VSCode
- Then follow [these instructions], under "Usage". TLDR: `sbt launchIDE` should work if `code` is on your PATH.

## Run the Examples

```sh
> sbt # to enter the sbt shell
> run # then select which example to run
```

You can choose between the examples:

## On Match Types

> Prefer reading the code to this README

When typing a GenServer, what we'd like to express is *which* replies are OK for which requests.

Some pseudo-erlt for this:

```erl
-enum call() :: (
              equal{n : integer()}
             , closer{n1: integer(), n2: integer()}
).

-enum reply() :: (
              equal{n : integer()}
             , closer{n1: integer(), n2: integer()}
).


% The following is made-up Erlangy syntax corresponding to a scala match type
-protocol call_reply ::
    call.equal -> reply.equal
    call.closer -> reply.closer.

-implement_protocol(call_reply).
handle_call(call.equal{X}, State) -> reply.equal{State =:= X};
handle_call(call.closer{X, Y}, State) ->
    Closer = ...code_here...,
    reply.closer{Closer};
```

This is what Scala match types really look like:

```scala
    // define the procol
    type CallReplyProtocol[C] = C match
      case Call.Equal  => EqualReply
      case Call.Closer => CloserReply

    // implement the procol
    def reply[C <: Counter.Call](c: C, s: Counter.State): CallReplyProtocol[C] = c match
      case x: Counter.Call.Equal  =>
        Counter.EqualReply(x.n == s)
      case x: Counter.Call.Closer =>
        val closer = if (Math.abs(x.n1 - s) < Math.abs(x.n2 - s)) then x.n1 else x.n2
        Counter.CloserReply(closer)

```

The docs for match types are in https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/match-types.html

- match types separate the data from how the data is used: the calculation of which reply type to use for a given call type is in the hands of the *user* of the enum rather than the definer of the enum. That's why they require more typing (on the keyboard) than GADTs for small examples.

> Note: It may be useful to compare match types in `./GenServerMatchTypes.scala` against the GADTs in `../experiments/Haskell\ simulation`.

- match types allow matching against constructors of multiple enums in a single pattern expression. We may or may not want this capability for ErlT.

- match types in Scala have [several restrictions](The docs for match types are in https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/match-types.html): for each of these we may want to see whether the same restrictions would apply for Erlt.
