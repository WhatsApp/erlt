# Eqwalizer milestones

Simple (naive) bidirectional type-checking. Main goal: to support full range of
Erlang surface syntax.

### Surface syntax (TODO)

- [ ] Catch
- [ ] Try/catch
- [ ] Try-of/catch
- [ ] List comprehensions
- [ ] Binary comprehensions
- [ ] Maps
- [ ] Records
- [ ] Anonymous functions
- [ ] Named inner functions
- [ ] Recursive type definitions
- [ ] Opaques
- [ ] Simple polymorphism
- [ ] Simple inference for unspecced funs
- [ ] Numeric tower
- [ ] Non-empty lists, maybe improper lists, etc

### Data-driven analysis

- [ ] Named inner functions
- [ ] Private functions - recursive and non-recursive.
- [ ] Dependencies between modules and functions in general.

Anyway, we would implement simple inference for non-recursive functions first.
