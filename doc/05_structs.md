# 5. Structs Rationale

ErlT introduces three new data structures - enums, structs, and shapes. This document describes structs and shapes

A *struct* is a nominal record and requires an explicit named definition. Struct can be seen as a replacement for Erlang records.

A *shape* doesnâ€™t require definition. The main use case it addresses is a generalization of a tuple, which allows names fields instead of only positional ones in a tuple. Intuitively, shapes can be seen as Erlang map with atom keys with invariably more restricted semantics in ST model.

> **The below is **out of date**. In particular, the below doesn't always distinguish between structs and shapes.

**Similar constructs in other languages**

* Elm records - https://elm-lang.org/docs/records -
  quite a good description of record
* Purescript - https://git.io/JfLsm
* Hugs/TREX - https://www.haskell.org/hugs/pages/hugsman/exts.html#sect7.2

## Operations

### Creating shapes

Just use map literals:

```erlang
Date = #{year => 2020, month => "April"},
Mode = #{language => "Erl2", dialect => "st"},
Point = #{x => 1, y => 1},
```

### Access

ErlT introduces the "." - dot operator for accessing fields of structs

```erlang
Date.year
Mode.dialect
```

As with Elm records, the accessor can be used only for a struct that has a required field.

```erlang
Date = #{year => 2020, month => "April"},
% OK
Date.year,
% Not OK
Date.language
```

### Update

The same as updating maps in Erlang.

```erlang
Point1 = Point#{x := 2},
Mode2 = #{language := "Erl2", dialect := "dt"},
```

Only existing fields can be updated (`:=` operation).
The previous and new values of the field should be of the same type.

## Types

The syntax of maps with mandatory associations is used for representing
record types in Erl1+ ST.

```erlang
-spec mk_date() -> #{year := integer(), month := string()}.
mk_date() -> #{year => 2020, month => "April"}.

-type point() :: {x := integer(), y := integer()}.

-spec get_x(point()) -> integer().
get_x(Point) -> Point.x.
```

## Extensible (open) structs

It is possible to write a function which can read a particular field `x` of
any structs (other fields are irrelevant).


```erlang
-spec get_x(#{x := integer(), _ := _}) -> integer().
get_x(GenericPoint) -> GenericPoint.x.

example() ->
    P1 = #{x => 1},
    P2 = #{x => 2, y => 3},
    P3 = #{x => 3, z => 4},
    Xs = [get_x(P1), get_x(P2), get_x(P3)],
    Xs.
```

To denote an open structs the special magic syntax for the last field `_ := _`
is used in the current implementation.

## Current limitations of structs in Erl1+ ST

**Pattern matching of structs is not supported** (for now)

The following code is not supported in Erl1+ ST.

```erlang
get_x(#{x := X, y := Y}) ->
  x.
```

**Representation of open structs in the language of types is quite limiting.**

It is possible to express a generic update for a "closed" structs:

```erlang
-spec update_x(#{ x: = A}, A) -> #{x := A}.
update_x(R, X) ->
    R#{ x := X }.
```

But it is not possible (for now) to express a generic update for an open structs:

```erlang
%% Does not work
-spec update_x(#{ x: = A, _ := _ }, A) -> #{x := A, _ := _}.
update_x(R, X) ->
    R#{ x := X }.
```

## Notes

In DT code all mentioned constructs behave as usual (as in classic Erlang).
The only extension (syntactic sugar) is dot operation for accessing atomic
associations.

Ideally (to be consistent), map literals should use `:=`,  so that structs
creation and structs update are symmetrical in syntax.

Ideally:

```erlang
Point1 = #{ x := 1, y:= 2},
Point2 = Point1#{ x := 2 }.
```
