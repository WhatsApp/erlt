# ErlT Reference

This `docs/` directory contains detailed descriptions of the various new and
altered language forms that constitute ErlT.

**More coming soon**

## ErlT DT

ErlT DT is the _dynamically typed_ core of ErlT which introduces new ways to
describe your programs, particularly its data structures.

**More coming soon - link to relevant reference files**

## ErlT ST

ErlT ST is the _statically typed_ ML-like layer that sits on top of DT, in
order to infer and check types at compile time. Beyond ruling out whole classes
of bugs and enforcing a standardised structure to code, it also opens the door
to deeper IDE integration and other tooling.

**More coming soon - link to relevant reference files**

## ErlT FFI

ErlT FFI is the _interface_ between ErlT DT and ST, allowing DT code to be exposed
as if it were statically-typed ST code.
